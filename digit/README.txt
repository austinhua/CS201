Questions: 
The distribution of the 3rd digit (n=2) in boys2008.txt is as expected for a random list of numbers. Each digit ranged from 9% to 14% of all digits, which is to be expected with variation.
The distribution of the 4th digit (n=3) in librarybooks.txt is also as expected for a random list of numbers. Each digit also ranged from 9% to 14%, which is expected with variation.
The distribution of the 2nd digit (n=1) in ncschools.txt between digits varied greatly, from 0% for certain digits to 18% for others and 45% for 4s. This is not as expected with a random list of numbers, however, because of the small sample size of numbers, this distribution can't be trusted.

Impressions:
It was unclear how we should describe the distribution of digits for each of the data files. Also, I think it would be very helpful to spend some time learning how to use scanners to do things like skip over comments.
